UML Design Flaws
In the UML design the flaws that we saw was that the UML needed to be normalized meaning some classes would have been excluded from the final UML.
The Name class would be included in the Employee and Student class where it will be needed, the Country and City classes would both be included in the Address class

Implementation Flaws
The implementation flaws that we had was using the JPA on our Repository we ended up having errors on our impl’s where it gave us many implementation methods, we delayed for a day because of trying to fix the error.
Our service tests gave us many errors one of the errors was when we had the test results they came back as “No tests found” but we eventually tried and fix it.
Another implementation flaw that we had was an intruder as a contributor in our GitHub project. We think that it was easy for the intruder to find our project since we are all naming our projects the same way on GitHub making it easy for the targets who want to copy our code to find us. We feared of being penalized for plagiarism with someone or people that we do not know.
